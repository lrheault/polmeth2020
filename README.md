# PolMeth XXXVII website

This is the code for the legacy website for the 2020 Annual Conference of the Society for Political Methodology (University of Toronto, July 16-18, 2020). The website was created based on similar initiatives from the field of computer science, and is a stripped down version forked from the [official ACL 2020 website repository](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-2020).

Just like ACL2020 and NAACL 2019, this repo is currently using the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
