## Hotel 

Rooms at a discounted rate are available at the Kimpton Saint George Hotel, at walking distance from the conference main location.  These rooms are available on a first-come, first-served basis.  We strongly encourage booking early.  The group rate is available until <b>June 15, 2020</b>.  The Society for Political Methodology does not handle individual reservations.  Changes and/or cancellations to hotel reservations should be made with the hotel directly.

A direct link for reservations will be posted here in 2020.

## University Lodging

We will provide participants with low-cost options for lodging at University summer residences.  More information coming in 2020.

## Food

Registered conference partipants will be provided with breakfast and lunch on all three days of the conference, and dinner on Friday.
