## PolMeth XXXVII Call for Proposals (Updated)

The 37th Annual Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology (PolMeth XXXVII) is currently accepting proposals until April 3, 2020.  The meeting will be a virtual (online) conference scheduled to take place from July 16 to July 18, 2020.

You are welcome to submit proposals using the following link (click "Abstract Submission" to proceed):

<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/spm/register" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/spm/register</a> 

Despite the transition to a virtual format, the objective is to maintain the usual setup of PolMeth conferences, with presentations and poster sessions.  We welcome both proposals that focus on methodological innovations, and proposals that apply cutting-edge methods to empirical problems of substantive interest.

The Society for Political Methodology is fully committed to fostering diversity and inclusion. We recognize that our impact as a subfield – from our ability to communicate our findings and to speak to a broad audience to our ability to consider the breadth of methodological possibilities – comes through diversity, and we actively seek and welcome people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities. You can read more about the Society's commitment to diversity here:

We require that all participants acknowledge and follow the Code of Conduct at SPM Events to ensure a harassment-free environment at the meeting. You will be asked to confirm your agreement in the application form. You can read the Code of Conduct on the SPM's website:

We welcome submissions from:

- All faculty members looking to present a paper or serve as a discussant;
- Graduate students looking to present a poster.
 
*Graduate students*: The annual meeting provides a fantastic opportunity for graduate students to receive extended feedback from scholars in the field of methodology.   Graduate student applications must be supported by a faculty recommendation. These recommendations are submitted through a webform sent after submitting a proposal, and must be completed by the application deadline (April 3). They are typically 2 to 4 paragraphs in length and discuss the student's poster proposal, methodological training, and any other information that would be relevant for the Graduate Student Selection Committee. We strongly encourage you to give your recommenders as much advance notice as possible.
 
The fee structure for the conference will be announced in due course, but will be considerably reduced compared to in-person conferences.

If you have questions or comments, please contact the conference organizers at <a href="mailto:polmeth@utoronto.ca">polmeth@utoronto.ca</a>.
