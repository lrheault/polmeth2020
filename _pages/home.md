<h2>PolMeth 2020</h2>

Welcome to the legacy website of the 2020 conference of the Society for Political Methodology, which took place between July 14 and July 17, 2020. 

Originally scheduled in person at the University of Toronto in Canada, PolMeth XXXVII was one of the first conferences to be held virtually at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. We had a dedicated conference website to show posters, but it is now offline. This is the legacy website that was originally used to announce the conference. 

You may download the final program as a pdf file below:
