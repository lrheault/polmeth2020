<h2>COVID-19 Update (March 13)</h2>

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has an impact on the planning of the annual meeting of the Society for Political Methodology.  The response to the outbreak is evolving rapidly, and many universities have imposed travel restrictions on faculty and students.

For now, the proposal submission deadline for PolMeth XXXVII is extended to April 3.  We initially aimed for an early submission deadline this year, with the objective of giving participants as much time as possible to make their travel plans.  Needless to say, the recent developments have disrupted that schedule. 

We are currently monitoring the impact of the outbreak on other academic events planned for the summer.  We will make sure to inform participants on the status of the conference before the registration period starts, and will post updates on this website as they become available.

<h2>PolMeth XXXVII at the University of Toronto</h2>

The 37th annual meeting of the Society for Political Methodology (PolMeth XXXVII) will take place in Toronto, Canada at the downtown campus of the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"} from July 16 to July 18, 2020.

The Society for Political Methodology, the National Science Foundation, and the host institution have supported a summer conference in political methodology since 1984.

Relevant information about the conference will be posted on this website.
