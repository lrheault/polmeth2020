## Diversity

The Society for Political Methodology is fully committed to fostering diversity and inclusion. We recognize that our impact as a subfield -- from our ability to communicate our findings and to speak to a broad audience to our ability to consider the breadth of methodological possibilities -- comes through diversity, and we actively seek and welcome people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities.

To ensure a harassment-free environment at the meeting, we require that all participants acknowledge and follow the [Code of Conduct at SPM Events](https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/spm/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion/code-of-conduct-at-spm-events){:target="_blank"}.
